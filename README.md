WS2812B is an extremely interesting LED that can emit light in red, green or blue - or any combination of these three colors, able to show a total of approximately 16 million different colors. On this board, diodes are arranged in a line of 10. You can even connect these sticks in a line. They are controlled by a single pin with only a few lines of code from Arduino IDE. That's possible thanks to the integrated controller inside the LED itself!
